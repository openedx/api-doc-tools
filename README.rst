edX API Documentation Tools
===========================

|pypi| |travis| |codecov| |readthedocs| |pyversions| |license|

A toolkit for documenting REST APIs that are created with `DRF`_.

.. _DRF: https://www.django-rest-framework.org/

The tools use `drf-yasg`_ (DRF, yet another Swagger generator) to generate an
`OpenAPI Specification`_, which is a .json/.yaml file that describes your API.
Additionally, this package makes it easy to configure your service to expose
generated OpenAPI specification under `/api-docs.yaml` and to serve interactive
documentation under `/api-docs`.

.. _drf-yasg: https://github.com/axnsan12/drf-yasg
.. _OpenAPI Specification: https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/

This library was developed for use with `Open edX`_ services, but could be used
to document any Django REST Framework API.

.. _Open edX: https://open.edx.org/
